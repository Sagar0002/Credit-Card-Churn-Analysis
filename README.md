# Bank Credit Card Service Churn Analysis

When a bank acquires a customer for its credit card service, three essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to consider include:

**1.  Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** This measures the expenses associated with acquiring each credit card customer, encompassing marketing, sales, and related costs. Lower CAC reflects efficient customer acquisition.
    
**2.  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** CLV estimates the total revenue the bank can expect to generate from a credit card customer over their relationship. A higher CLV indicates that the customer’s value surpasses the acquisition cost, ensuring long-term profitability.
    
**3.  Churn Rate:** Churn rate is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the number of credit card customers who have left during a specific period divided by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period.
    

These KPIs help the bank assess the effectiveness of its strategies in acquiring credit card customers and gauge the potential long-term financial benefit of these acquisitions.

In order to maximize profitability, the bank aims to minimize CAC and Churn while maximizing CLV.
